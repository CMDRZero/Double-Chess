A standard board has the following indexation:


  77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70
  67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60
             .
             .
             .
  17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10
  07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00

This is because in my head higher bits go onto and to the left.
This is only for whites side however, and black as inverted ordering.
Also note this means a u6 can represent the full position and is y ++ x;
